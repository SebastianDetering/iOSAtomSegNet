Expensive electron microscopes acquire TEM images by firing a focused electron beam which scatters off of very small samples in order to achieve an image of atoms.  Unlike life-size photos, electron microscope photos at the atomic scale are imaging probabilities rather than classical structures because atoms are governed by quantum mechanics.  For this reason and because scattering adds randomness, atomic resolution images can be very noisy.")
